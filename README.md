# Welcome!

My name is Jacob Pettit and I'm a machine learning researcher at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov). I have my Bachelor's degree in [Computational Science](https://www.sc.fsu.edu) from [Florida State University (FSU)](https://www.fsu.edu/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning and its applications, and leveraging reinforcement learning for discrete optimization (like in neural architecure search).

I keep a blog [here](https://themerge.substack.com) and aim to put out an email newsletter (optimistically, but not really) once a week. I write about tech and AI and am working on a series of interviews detailing a "day in the life" of various people in tech and science. Consider subscribing if that's interesting to you!

## About Me

You've heard about my work stuff up at the top, so I'm not going to talk about that here. I've got several hobbies, chief among them are climbing, surfing, making fancy coffee (e.g. [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com) or [Chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com)) and hiking with my wife and our dogs. I consider myself a bit of a foodie and I'm always looking for recommendations for a new place to try in the SF Bay Area (if you've got a place you want to recommend, ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/pettitjf)). I'm generally curious and am often learning something new about some branch of science or math that's completely unrelated to my job. Thanks for reading!
