# Welcome!

My name is Jacob Pettit and I'm a machine learning researcher at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov). I have my Bachelor's degree in [Computational Science](https://www.sc.fsu.edu) from [Florida State University (FSU)](https://www.fsu.edu/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning and its applications, and leveraging reinforcement learning for discrete optimization (like in neural architecure search).

I keep a weekly blog sharing papers and code called [The Merge](https://themerge.substack.com) and a personal blog named [Welcome to My Brain](https://jacobpettit.substack.com). Consider subscribing if either (or both) interest you!

## About Me

You've heard about my work stuff up at the top, so I'm not going to talk about that here. I've got several hobbies, chief among them are climbing, surfing, making fancy coffee (e.g. [Aeropress](https://aeropress.com) or [Chemex](https://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com)) and hiking with my wife and our dogs. I consider myself a bit of a foodie. I'm generally curious and am often learning something new about some branch of science or math that's completely unrelated to my job. Thanks for reading!
