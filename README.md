# Welcome!

My name is Jacob Pettit and I'm a machine learning researcher at [Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory](https://www.llnl.gov). I have my Bachelor's degree in [Computational Science](https://www.sc.fsu.edu) from [Florida State University (FSU)](https://www.fsu.edu/). My research focuses on reinforcement learning and its applications, and leveraging reinforcement learning for discrete optimization (like in neural architecure search).

I keep a blog [here](https://themerge.substack.com) and aim to put out an email newsletter once a week. I write about tech and AI and am working on a series of interviews detailing a "day in the life" of various people in tech. Consider subscribing if that's interesting to you!
